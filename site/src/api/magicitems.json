Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.

Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\n\nPlacing a _bag of holding_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _handy haversack_, _portable hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"Systems Reference Document","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"bag-of-tricks","name":"Bag of Tricks","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty.

You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

If the target is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.","rarity":"legendary","requires_attunement":"requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"Systems Reference Document","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"tome-of-clear-thought","name":"Tome of Clear Thought","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This book contains memory and logic exercises, and its words are charged with magic.

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.\n\nMost sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.\n\nSentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"Systems Reference Document","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"orb-of-dragonkind","name":"Orb of Dragonkind","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five _Orbs of Dragonkind_ (or _Dragon Orbs_) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts _suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\n\n**_Random Properties_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ has the following random properties:\n\n* 2 minor beneficial properties\n* 1 minor detrimental property\n* 1 major detrimental property\n\n**_Spells_**. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: _cure wounds_ (5th-level version, 3 charges), _daylight_ (1 charge), _death ward_ (2 charges), or _scrying_ (3 charges).\n\nYou can also use an action to cast the _detect magic_ spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\n**_Call Dragons_**. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\n**_Destroying an Orb_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A _disintegrate_ spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.","rarity":"artifact","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"Systems Reference Document","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"aberrant-agreement","name":"Aberrant Agreement","type":"Scroll","desc":"This long scroll bears strange runes and seals of eldritch powers.

The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal.

Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical.

Anuraag used the crucible to create so many monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the bottom of a mighty chasm. If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw against the crucible's powerful transmutation magic. If this saving throw fails, the creature's body liquefies and the creature is blinded, deafened, and paralyzed until the transformation is complete. The creature's equipment doesn't dissolve; as a result, most creatures are stripped naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into another creature. If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its original form by a _resurrection_ spell or similar magic. If the process reaches completion, the creature transforms into another creature as if affected by a _shapechange_ spell. The transformed creature must make a successful DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose its memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features, which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly born version of the creature it transformed into.

Gax, later known to history as Gax the Great, was a mysterious figure renowned for his uncanny ability to weave together martial and magical combat in unique and powerful ways. An unparalleled master at crafting magic arms and armor, Gax is known for a number of fantastic, magical items. He is said to have created his first great item of magic when he was still a young apprentice. At that time, his master was an old wizard who mercilessly drilled the fundamentals of magic into the young apprentice's mind. The studious old wizard also derisively dismissed Gax's ideas for combining magic and battle and openly berated Gax for his love of swordplay, weaponry, and armor. Determined to prove that his theories were possible (and, truth be told, equally determined to spite his master), Gax apprenticed himself at the same time to a renowned weapon smith and armorer in a nearby town. The youth quickly proved as skilled at metalcraft as he was at magic. Young Gax spent his days in magical study and his nights working in the smith's forge, crafting an exquisite breastplate of the finest mithral. He imbued the breastplate's delicate glyphs and symbols with powerful protective magic far beyond the ability of magic-wielders many years his senior. When the breastplate was finally completed, Gax proudly showed it to his mentor. The smith was so impressed that he coveted it for himself, and he demanded that Gax give the breastplate to him. When Gax refused, the smith attempted to take it by force. At the end of a quick but violent scuffle, the smith lay dead near the very anvil on which Gax had finished his wondrous breastplate. Shocked and terrified, the boy fled, running to the small stone building where the old wizard lived. Hoping the wizard would be understanding about what happened and suitably impressed with Gax's magical breastplate, the boy breathlessly recounted recent events. The old wizard was neither understanding nor impressed. He coldly chided Gax for wasting his time on a “trinket” and rebuked Gax for taking a life over “nothing more than a worthless piece of pretty metal.” Furious and defeated, Gax shouted profanities at his master before running off into the woods. Gax decided that he would make his way in the world on his own terms. He would learn everything he could about magic and combat, he would excel in both, and he would do whatever it took to fuse the two into what would eventually become known as the style of the battlecaster. From that day on, until the day he drew his final breath, Gax was never without his beloved _battlecaster's armor_.

Celebrants participate in chaotic dancing, hypnotic swaying, and frenzied distortions of their serpentine bodies as if seized with madness. Snakes are also typically involved in the Revelry, with participants often wearing them around their bodies or otherwise handling them in various symbolic and proscribed manners. The rite culminates in an ecstatic, mystical fervor and extreme loss of inhibition known as Shiv'ash (literally, “the madness and ecstasy of the moon”). In this state, the lamia lose all self-control. They shout excitedly, shrieking out prophecies, and engage in all manner of debauchery. The Night of the Blood Moon occurs once per year. It is the most sacred of all Revelries—a time when alliances are sealed, blood sacrifices are made, wars are ended, and new matriarchs are chosen. It is during a Night of the Blood Moon long ago that a powerful lamia cult created the _blood moon orb._ Little is known about the _blood moon orb_, save that it contains blood drops from the one hundred sacrifices made that night.

He would take the golden cup back to his employer, but he would claim the magnificent armor for himself! Once back at his base, Gregor set about the long and difficult task of restoring and repairing the armor. He hired the best armorers and weaponsmiths to ensure the armor was brought back to all its former glory. Of course, he also could not resist having his smiths add new detailing to the armor to be sure everyone knew it was his and his alone. Gregor wore his terrifying spiked armor on every mission and campaign from that day on. He even mastered close-combat techniques that helped him utilize the armor spikes. Gregor derived a perverse pleasure from driving the spikes into his enemies and watching the blood drip onto his armor. Because of this, Gregor named his beloved plate _blood spike armor_.

Its covers often reflect light as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and [[Shadow Fey]] (see _Tome of Beasts_). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot‑wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an [[Overshadow]] (see _Tome of Beasts 2_) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, [[Fey Lords and Ladies]] (see _Tome of Beasts_), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in _Deep Magic for 5th Edition_. At the GM's discretion, spells from _Deep Magic for 5th Edition_ can be replaced with other spells of similar levels and similarly related to darkness, illusion, or shadows, such as _invisibility_ or _major image_. | DC | Effect |\n| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 8 | Obscuring a path and removing all signs of passage (30 feet per point over 7) |\n| 10 | Creating a grove of trees (30 feet across per point over 9) |\n| 11 | Creating or drying up a lake or pond (up to 10 feet across per point over 10) |\n| 12 | Creating a flowing stream (1 foot wide per point over 11) |\n| 13 | Overgrowing an existing road with brush or trees (300 feet per point over 12) |\n| 14 | Shifting a river to a new course (300 feet per point over 13) |\n| 15 | Moving a forest (300 feet per point over 14) |\n| 16 | Creating a small hill, riverbank, or cliff (10 feet tall per point over 15) |\n| 17 | Turning a small forest into grassland or clearing, or vice versa (30 feet across per point over 16) |\n| 18 | Creating a new river (10 feet wide per point over 17) |\n| 19 | Turning a large forest into grassland, or vice versa (300 feet across per point over 19) |\n| 20 | Creating a new mountain (1,000 feet high per point over 19) |\n| 21 | Drying up an existing river (reducing width by 10 feet per point over 20) |\n| 22 | Shrinking an existing hill or mountain (reducing 1,000 feet per point over 21) | Written by an elvish princess at the Court of Silver Words, this volume encodes her understanding and mastery of shadow.

This bugbear necromancer was once the henchman of an accomplished practitioner of the dark arts named Varrus. She started as a bodyguard and tough, but her keen intellect caught her master's attention. He eventually took her on as an apprentice. Moxug is fascinated with fear, and some say she doesn't eat but instead sustains herself on the terror of her victims. She eventually betrayed Varrus, sabotaging his attempt to become a lich, and luxuriated in his fear as he realized he would die rather than achieve immortality. According to rumor, the first _craven's heart_ she crafted came from the body of her former master.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"crawling-cloak","name":"Crawling Cloak","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This unusual cloak is made of many overlapping, broad strips of thick cloth.","rarity":"varies","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"crimson-carpet","name":"Crimson Carpet","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This rolled bundle of red felt is 3-feet long and 1-foot wide, and it weighs 10 pounds.

Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol.

The vile wyrm delighted in erupting from the volcano to breathe destruction and death on the people of the near-by towns. For generations, the oppressed people did what they could to combat the dragon, yet Abraxys's reign of terror continued. Finally, a young warrior named Rathume pledged to rid the land of the cruel dragon. The townsfolk laughed—she was young and inexperienced. How could she hope to defeat such a monster? Rathume was undeterred. What she lacked in experience, she made up for in courage. What she lacked in battle prowess, she made up for in faith. The very next dawn, when Abraxys emerged from the volcano and swooped toward the town, the gates opened and Rathume emerged, holding a spear and clutching a large, wooden shield. The ancient dragon landed and grinned maliciously at the sight of the small human, standing alone in the grass. Abraxys roared with laughter as the girl strode confidently toward the mighty beast, quickly closing the distance between them. The great dragon drew back and prepared to incinerate the brash young woman. Suddenly, Rathume raised her shield and rushed forward. The startled dragon breathed forth gouts of flame, engulfing Rathume, yet she continued to rush forward, unaffected by the fire! Rathume plunged her spear into the dragon's belly and there was a sudden, fiery blast which consumed them both. Only Rathume's shield remained. It was blackened by the flames, yet otherwise unscathed. Miraculously, the powerful magic of the dragon and the heroic fire in Rathume's heart had become somehow fused with the shield. Many generations of brave warriors have carried the _fire shield of Rathume_ from then on, striving always to live up to the legend of the brave Rathume.

From soup to cheese, they told tales of a hero possessed of a “Folding Door” that fit in his pocket. When “unfolded” to full size it could be set anywhere (a stone wall, a tree, a waterfall) and opened to anywhere in the wide world, whisking the hero and her companions away from trouble in a trice. Too young to separate fact from fiction, yet old enough to recognize the prowess of their father, they asked me to craft them such a door. I explained that an object able to produce instant, multiple-location, inter-planar conjuration was impossible. To ease the sting of their disappointment, I explained that their story, while pure nonsense, was still interesting from an etymological standpoint. Centuries ago, a wizard named Foulton Konig was famed for creating magical doors. Sadly, specific details are lacking as his labs, libraries, and notes were lost when his mansion was destroyed in a catastrophically thorough, but historically non‑specific way. My children were fascinated to hear my theory that metaplasmic drift in the language (doubtless working in concert with poor education and rustic accents) eventually led a genuine product of magical artifice (a door made by Foulton) to eventually enter folklore as a “Folding Door.” This was my first brush with my eventual life's work and passion: my endless quest to separate the history of artifice from stories of the artificial. As such, I feel an odd gratitude toward their old governess, and occasionally feel a bit of remorse about ending her employment over the incident. Still, there are genuine wonders aplenty in the world without cluttering the minds of the young with nonsense. Mine is an endless struggle to separate fact from fancy, as shown by events of three months ago. Out conducting research, (while cunningly disguised to mix among the common folk) a seemingly reputable vendor of magical curiosities offered to sell me “a fragment of a Foulton Door.” (Note Fig 1. a splinter of wood, slightly longer than a handspan across.) Destroyed long ago, so powerful were the original doors that if even a small piece such as this were incorporated into an existing door, it would become imbued with the power of a magic portal. A quick check revealed the shard of wood _did_, in fact, possess a powerful, unfamiliar dweomer. With dubious curiosity, I bought it, returned to my lab, and followed their instructions. My tools and talents are not designed for anything so base as carpentry, but in the pursuit of truth I dutifully paid several hours of my precious time, a set of skinned knuckles, and one badly hammered thumb to patch the small piece of wood into one of the secondary pantry's doors. I then inserted the key to my winter lodgings, concentrated, and opened the door as the merchant had instructed me. Nothing happened, of course, and when I checked, the wood no longer showed any traces of magic. When I returned to the merchant to demand both an ethical and economic accounting, he had the audacity to imply it was my own fault, and refused to admit his obvious charlatanry or refund the twenty gold I had spent. While I regularly spend much greater sums in the course of my research, I nevertheless engaged the constabulary to bring the fellow into custody, as behavior such as this does nothing but defraud the simple-minded and tarnish the reputation of those engaging in legitimate arcane pursuits…. Rumored to be pieces of destroyed magical doors, fragments of a _Foulton door_ are varied in their shapes and sizes. Flinders of wood, bands of iron, screws, or even shards of broken glass are the most common, while intact and usable hinges, knobs, or entire planks of wood are rare. Although useless on their own, if you incorporate a fragment into an existing door, its magic allows that door to open to another location, even one on another plane of existence. The DC increases by 1 for each fragment added to a door beyond the first, but the DC can never be higher than 25. You can remove a fragment from a door by repeating the check, but removing a fragment doesn't result in a quirk. When a door has only one fragment, you can use an action to open the door to a door, doorway, or other similar entryway or egress of your choice within 100 miles of the door, and the travel is one‑way, meaning a creature that steps through the door can't step back through it. The door remains open for up to 1 minute. The door can't be used this way again until the next dawn. When a door has two or more fragments, it has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Opening the door expends 1 charge. A door with three or more fragments develops unique characteristics. Choose a characteristic when you incorporate the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th fragments. At the GM's discretion, you can choose an additional characteristic for every three fragments beyond the 12th. You can choose each characteristic only once, unless the characteristic's description says otherwise. The characteristics are presented in alphabetical order. If a characteristic requires a number of fragments, the door must have at least that number of fragments to gain that characteristic. If a characteristic requires you to incorporate a nonmagical object, such as a pane of glass or doorknob, into the door, you must incorporate that item before you can use that characteristic. Incorporating a nonmagical object into the door doesn't result in a quirk, but failure means you didn't incorporate the object and must repeat the check to incorporate it. You can choose this characteristic more than once, increasing the number of locations to which the door can be bound. Each time you select it, you must incorporate a new object that can be turned into the door and that object must be one of the targets of the magical bond. If you previously incorporated an object with multiple sides, like a hanging lantern or a wheel with spokes, you can make a different side of that object the target of the magical bond instead of incorporating a new object. title: How many fragments for a full door?\nSince the fragment sizes are so variable, the number of fragments required to “complete” a _Foulton door_ is at the GM's discretion. Most adventurers go their entire lifetimes without ever constructing more than half a _Foulton door_, and there is no reason the players or GM should feel obligated to create a full door out of the fragments. Some groups might never have more than three fragments while others might have twenty. As the GM, choose whatever number or style best fits your group and the story you all want to tell. The variability of the characteristics, fragment powers, and quirks leave you and your group plenty of room to make the door as complex, unique, and fragmented as you need it to be. Each fragment you incorporate into a door increases the door's power. When you incorporate a fragment into the door, roll a d100 and consult the Fragment Powers table. Alternatively, your GM might choose a specific power for the fragment you incorporate, such as an iron band fragment that increases the door's damage threshold or an old, battered doorknob that leads to a particular plane of the Hells. Roll: [[Foulton Door#^powers]] | dice: 1d% | Power |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1-20 | The distance the destination can be from the door's current location increases by 100 miles. |\n| 21-40 | The door's hit points increase by 10. |\n| 41-55 | The door can remain open for 1 additional minute. |\n| 56-70 | The door's damage threshold increases by 2. |\n| 71-80 | The door's maximum number of charges increases by 1. The door regains a number of expended charges daily at dawn equal to the nearest die type, rounded down ( 1d4 for 5 charges, 1d6 for 6 charges, etc.). |\n| 81-90 | The door's Armor Class increases by 1. |\n| 91-95 | The door has immunity to one additional type of damage (GM's choice). |\n| 96-100 | The door can travel to one additional plane (GM's choice). | When you incorporate a fragment into a door, you must make an appropriate tool check, as detailed in the _Foulton door_ entry. When you succeed or fail by 5 or more, the door gains a quirk. Here we present tables of the types of quirks the door can acquire. Lesser quirks happen if the check succeeds (positive) or fails (negative) by 5–9. Greater quirks happen if the check succeeds (positive) or fails (negative) by 10 or more. When the door develops a quirk, consult the appropriate Quirks table, rolling the indicated die. Alternatively, your GM might choose a quirk that best fits the group or the situation of the success or failure. At the GM's discretion, if the door has a quirk you want to remove, spells such as _fabricate_, _greater restoration_, or _remove curse_ might remove one or all of a door's quirks. Alternatively, the GM might require you to complete a specific task related to the quirk before removing it. (For ability checks that fail by 5-9) | d8 | Quirk |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | Each creature that steps through the door exits the other side soaking wet as if it just stepped out of a lake. |\n| 2 | The first time a creature steps through the door each day, it decreases in size by 10 percent.

Each creature that steps through the door is poisoned for 1 minute. |\n| 6 | The door makes noise, such as creaky hinges, a dinging bell, a trumpet blast, or similar loud sound, when it is opened, which is audible within 100 feet of the door at the origin and destination locations. |\n| 7 | The door dampens sound for travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is deafened for 10 minutes. |\n| 8 | The door brings misfortune on travelers.

Each creature that steps through the door has advantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. |\n| 6 | Each creature that steps through the door becomes aesthetically pleasing to other creatures and has advantage on Charisma checks to interact socially with other creatures for 10 minutes. |\n| 7 | The door becomes more accepting of new fragments. Any creature incorporating a fragment has advantage on the check. |\n| 8 | The door brings fortune on travelers.

Each creature that steps through the door arrives at the destination 1 hour after it stepped through the door at the origin. This quirk replaces the lesser negative quirk that also makes the door's travel no longer instantaneous, if the door has that quirk. |\n| 4 | Each creature that steps through the door must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of fragments in the door). On a failure, a creature arrives at the destination but is incapacitated for 1 minute. |\n| 5 | When the door closes, it can't be reopened for 1 hour. |\n| 6 | When you open the door, it expends 2 charges instead of 1. | (For ability checks that succeed by 10+) | d6 | Quirk |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | When you open the door, there is a 50 percent chance the door doesn't expend a charge. This quirk replaces the lesser positive quirk that also gives the door a chance to not expend a charge, if the door has that quirk. |\n| 2 | If the destination location is dangerous, the door grows warm to the touch and is “stuck” for a moment when you try to open it, requiring you to pull or push a second time to open the door fully. |\n| 3 | You no longer need a key to open the door. You must still use an action and expend a charge (or charges if the door has that quirk) to open the door. In addition, if the door has the Foulton's Key characteristic, the maximum number of Foulton Keys you can tie to the door increases to 4. |\n| 4 | The door becomes more accepting of new fragments. The DC to incorporate a fragment reduces by 5. |\n| 5 | The Fragment Power of the fragment you incorporated into the door when you received this quirk becomes more potent. The fragment's numerical power is doubled. For example, if the fragment's power increases the distance the door can travel by 100 miles, it increases that distance by 200 miles instead. |\n| 6 | Each creature that steps through the door regains 2d6 hit points. When a creature regains hit points in this way, it can't regain hit points by stepping through the door again until it finishes a short or long rest. |","rarity":"fabled ","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"fountmail","name":"Fountmail","type":"Armor","desc":"This armor is a dazzling white suit of chain mail with an alabaster-colored steel collar that covers part of the face.

The thing Riggs most hated about himself was his stature. Despite his considerable skill with magic, the little halfling's most profound wish was that he had been born big, strong, and physically powerful. Gax always told his friend that true strength comes from within, but Riggs continued to lament his physical weakness and size. Finally, when he could bear his friend's complaints no longer, Gax gave Riggs a wonderful gift—a pair of magnificent, enchanted gauntlets. When wearing the gauntlets, Riggs gained great strength and found his magic enhanced in wondrous ways. In time, Gax and Riggs came to a small village near a high mountain pass. The people there welcomed the strangers, who happily remained in the village for many weeks. Then, the giants attacked. Gax and Riggs battled the giants and did everything they could to defend the village. Riggs used the power of his gauntlets to great effect, but in the end, he found it was his bravery and willingness to give his life to protect the villagers that truly won the day. Gax had been right—Riggs's true strength had indeed been inside him all along. From then on, Riggs was known as Riggslet Giantsbane. Many years later, the brave halfling returned to the mountain village and retired, content to live out his days among the people he had protected years earlier. Riggs never had children, but he did take on an apprentice, a small girl with a gift for magic. It is believed that Riggs bestowed his magical gauntlets to his student on his deathbed, though the girl remained silent on the subject. She left the village a few days after her mentor's death to make her mark on the world. If she had Riggs's _gauntlets of the arcane fist_ with her when she left, none can say.

His closest companion was his mount, a highly intelligent and fiercely loyal griffon with golden feathers. One fateful autumn day, wyverns attacked Bronwyn and his griffon while the pair flew high above a barren plain. During the battle, Bronwyn's griffon suffered several poisonous stings. Weakened, the animal was unable to remain aloft. Bronwyn and the griffon plummeted to the rocky ground far below. In a final, heroic act, the griffon twisted in midair so its body took the brunt of the impact. Although badly injured, Bronwyn survived the fall. His brave griffon did not. Wracked with grief and guilt, the ranger plucked a single golden feather from the dead griffon then buried his loyal mount there among the rocks where it died. Bronwyn carried that golden feather with him for many months. Eventually, he had a magical shield crafted to honor his fallen friend. Bronwyn watched as the expert craftsman's hammer fell repeatedly on the new shield, giving it shape and form. Just as the last hammer blow fell, Brownwyn tossed the feather onto the shield. The plumage vanished as the craftsman's hammer struck, as if the golden feather had somehow fused with the metal.

Althaghast dwelled in a hilltop tower within a mist-shrouded realm suddenly infested with undead. The people lived in fear, for the undead ranks were inexplicably growing unchecked. At last, Althaghast knew he had to restore the balance. He carved a gleaming skull from solid alabaster, and for many weeks worked his most powerful magic upon it. The white necromancer used his strange skull to great effect, rooting out nests of vampires, eventually dragging the screaming vampire lord into the purifying light of the sun. He defeated a powerful spectre haunting a lonely road, and he even put a terrible lich to rest. When the balance between life, death, and unlife had at last been restored, Althaghast returned to the solitude of his tower. One evening, just after sunset, a beautiful woman came to speak with him. She asked about his magical alabaster skull, which he admitted was secured elsewhere in the tower. It was then that he noticed, for the first time, her deathly pale complexion. And her fangs.

He even single‑handedly saved an aged cleric from the very jaws of the ancient red dragon Balmortigyrn. In time, however, death must come to all mortals, even those as brave and valiant as Sir Velamish, whose death came at the hands of a vile pit fiend. Velamish and the pit fiend had been locked in combat for hours on a barren field just outside a city which the paladin was sworn to protect. Though terribly wounded himself, the paladin prepared to deliver the killing blow to the mortally wounded pit fiend. Before Velamish's blade could bite into the evil creature's flesh, however, it unleashed a violent ball of flame which engulfed them both. When the flames finally died out, both Velamish and the pit fiend were gone. All that remained on the barren ground was Sir Velamish's dented helm. The people wept in sadness and gratitude at Sir Velamish's sacrifice. Lifting their eyes to the heavens, they gave thanks to the gods of good. Then, a miracle occurred. A blinding flash emanated from the helm. When their sight returned, the people marveled. Sir Velamish's helm was no longer damaged! It had been returned to pristine condition! The city's elderly high priest lifted the helm above his head and vowed to all those present that it would be forever a symbol of sacrifice and valor in the unending crusade against evil.

Ventu was a follower of a fringe religious order which believed all the world's ills stemmed from magic not granted by a deity. The order claimed that wizards, sorcerers, and their ilk were to blame for all the evil in the land as that magic was tainted by human hands rather than gifted by divine ones. Lord Ventu held tremendous sway in the kingdom, and he brought that considerable power to bear on his self-appointed mission of wiping out every last practitioner of magic in the land who wielded magic without the blessing of a deity. Thus began the _Purge Arcana_. To carry out the _Purge Arcana_, Ventu needed loyal warriors who could seek out and destroy practitioners of the arcane arts. To this end, he assembled a squad of like-minded zealots, and he outfitted them with breastplates enchanted by priests of his deity to neutralize magic and aid in killing those that wielded it. For years, Ventu's Mage Hunters scoured his kingdom, killing anyone who dared to practice magic. It was a dark and dangerous time, filled with fear and paranoia. Over time, Ventu grew increasingly paranoid, and his actions became more and more bizarre. Eventually, he decided that even his own Mage Hunters had become tainted by prolonged contact with the very magic that they were tasked to destroy. He summoned his most loyal soldiers and ordered them to round up and murder the Mage Hunters. For the Mage Hunters, it was the final straw. Many fled the kingdom in fear, but a few banded together and stormed Ventu's fortress. They killed the mad zealot then looked on his lifeless body in shocked disbelief. The Mage Hunters were appalled at what they had done, but they were even more appalled at what had transpired in the kingdom. It was as if Ventu had woven a spell on everyone and, now that he was dead, the spell was broken. The Mage Hunters disbanded. Most renounced what they had done and destroyed their magical breastplates.

When the beautiful mermaid's eyes finally fluttered open, Lord Markum fell deeply and hopelessly in love. The mermaid explained that her people were suffering relentless attacks from a tribe of sahuagin. The mermaid had been wounded during the last raid and had washed upon the rocks near Lord Markum's keep. Markum was desperate to help. He was a powerful warrior, but he could not simply hold his breath and wade into the sea with his plate mail and great sword. He called for his oldest and most trusted advisor, the wizard Pelgroth.

However, so perfectly matched were they that their duel ended in a draw. Then a rematch. And re-rematch. And so it continued for decades, until each man's skill and senses began to fail. At that point, caring about nothing but the duel, each commissioned a particular sword to overcome their fading senses; Sir Clive's hearing loss, and Lord Ivor's dimming eyesight. Sir Clive was convinced he could duel if he could but _hear_ the blows land and blocks asserted. Lord Ivor knew he could duel if he could but _see_ the clash of blades. Legend has it that they didn't really _want_ to kill each other, but in the end, old age came for them both, leaving their weapons to fate. These paired scimitars are each named and engraved with unique symbols.

He had been raised by an ancient treant known as Oak Heart. The treant was teacher, mentor, friend, and protector to the young druid—together, the two tended the forest and all that lived within it. Late one night, a sudden storm crashed across the sky. Ruatha watched as lightning lit up the night sky. Seconds later, he saw a flickering, yellow-orange haze in the distance then a cloud of smoke. Forest fire! Ruatha rushed through the forest, shouting for the animals to run toward the safety of the stream. Ruatha could hear the deep, rumbling voice of Oak Heart in the distance, rousing the trees of the forest. Through the confusion and smoke, panicked forest animals ran from the flames, and trees lumbered past Ruatha. After what seemed a lifetime, the singed and soot-covered druid finally dropped to his knees on the far side of the stream. Glancing around quickly, the exhausted druid was relieved to see that most of the forest animals had made it to safety, as had many of the trees. They were already re-rooting themselves into the ground and becoming still again. Coughing uncontrollably, the exhausted young druid collapsed on the ground. Ruatha's eyes flickered open. It was dawn and the storm was over. On the far side of the stream, Ruatha could see the devastation left behind by the forest fire. As far as the eye could see, the ground was black and burned. Ruatha noticed a large, still shape in the distance, near a group of smoldering tree trunks. His heart sank—it was Oak Heart. The druid transformed into a hawk and soared to his friend. Oak Heart was dead, his bark blackened and charred. The ancient treant had died trying to save every last tree he could. Devastated, Ruatha slowly cut into the burned remains of his friend and carefully removed the heartwood. He fashioned the wood into the likeness of his friend and mentor and carried it with him for the remainder of his days. While holding the pocket-sized figurine, you can cast the _druidcraft_ spell from it at will. Once it has been used to become an awakened tree, the figurine can't be used in this way again until 3 days have passed.","rarity":"fabled ","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"oakwood-wand","name":"Oakwood Wand","type":"Wand","desc":"You can use this wand as a spellcasting focus.

The more difficult the odds, the better, and he, especially, lived for one‑on‑one combat. Often, Korgg would throw down his greataxe when facing a single foe and rush head-long into battle. Most such battles ended with the mighty Korgg literally tearing his opponent apart with his bare hands. One of Korgg's greatest battles was with a fearsome bulette. Korgg was tasked with vanquishing the strange creature, who had been rampaging the area and terrifying the populace. The half-orc found the bulette in a cave. Korgg marveled at the strange creature's thick, red hide. Then, with a deafening cry of ferocious rage, Korgg rushed into the cave and attacked the bulette. The battle lasted for what seemed an eternity. Finally, with an explosion of power, Korgg snapped the huge creature's neck with his bare hands, killing it at last. The creature's blood washed over them both, staining the creature's hide a deeper red. Korgg dragged the bulette's body back to town and into the square, where he loudly declared his victory to all who would hear him. In lieu of his promised payment, he instructed the most skilled armorer he could find to strip the hide from the bulette's body and craft a suit of armor worthy of Korgg and his great victory. When Korgg donned his impressive new armor, the half-orc felt a rush of primal power, as if the soul of the bulette had entered his body. Korgg wore his armor on countless adventures and battles. The mere sight of the mighty half-orc in his _red bulette's hide_ was often enough to frighten most opponents into submission before a single axe blow had fallen. None can say with certainty what finally became of the mighty barbarian or his red armor. There are those who believe the famous armor sits in the bulette's original cave, Korgg having gone there for his final rest. Many have searched for the cave in hopes of finding Korgg's armor, but so far, no one has been able to find it. While wearing this armor, you can cast the _jump_ spell from it at will, but you can target only yourself when you do so.","rarity":"fabled ","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"reef-splitter","name":"Reef Splitter","type":"Weapon","desc":"The head of this warhammer is constructed of undersea volcanic rock and etched with images of roaring flames and boiling water.

A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A creature trapped within the bubble is restrained unless it has a swimming speed and can't breathe unless it can breathe water. If the target is an object, it becomes soaked in water, any fire effects are extinguished, and any acid effects are negated. The bubble floats in the exact spot where it was conjured for up to 1 minute, unless blown by a strong wind or moved by water. The bubble has 50 hit points, AC 8, immunity to acid damage and vulnerability to piercing damage. The inside of the bubble also has resistance to all damage except piercing damage. The bubble disappears after 1 minute or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. When not in use, this rod can be commanded to take liquid form and be stored in a small vial. The rod regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"rod-of-conveyance","name":"Rod of Conveyance","type":"Rod","desc":"The top of this rod is capped with a bronze horse head, and its foot is decorated with a horsehair plume.

These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title. The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings.

The Emperor was protected by the Order of the Sacred Mountain, a force of eleven elite, hand‑picked warrior-monks. When each initiate first entered the Order, he or she received a special suit of _sacred mountain armor_, which the initiate then carried, alone, up the slopes of the Sacred Mountain to the shrine at the mountain's summit. Once there, the monk placed the armor on the altar and knelt in prayer throughout the night. At dawn, the warrior donned the _sacred mountain armor,_ now blessed by the spirit of the mountain itself, and descended the slopes as a full member of the Order. Many years into the Emperor's reign, the capital was besieged by a powerful ogre mage called Ukani‑sago, who led a force of ogres and orcs. Ukani‑sago vowed to cut off the Emperor's head and parade it among his troops on a spear. The ogre mage and his forces swarmed the capital city, killing and burning everyone and everything in their path. The Emperor's soldiers fought valiantly, but were soon overwhelmed, and the ogre horde surrounded the Emperor's palace. Hopelessly outnumbered, the Order of the Sacred Mountain prepared to make their last stand. They drew up defensive positions in the inner courtyard and formed a circle around Emperor Shin. The warrior-monks fought with honor and valor. One by one, however, they were slaughtered—the odds against them were simply too great.

Each of these warriors was said to be the equal of ten normal men, and each was sworn to protect the city and the Padishah with their lives. Each of the Seven Scorpions carried a golden scimitar. These mystical swords were said to have been forged by genies many centuries ago and could cleave through solid rock. Possessing a _scorpion sting scimitar_ was the highest accolade one could receive within the desert kingdoms. If a scorpion warrior fell in battle, one of their fellows was honor‑bound to recover the fallen warrior's scimitar and return it to the Padishah.

If the space where the shabti would grow is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the shabti, the shabti doesn't grow. Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti's description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti's Armor Class is 13, and it doesn't have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti's description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti's description. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a _heroes' feast_. The benefits don't set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can't be used again until 30 days have passed. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast _cure wounds_ (4th-level version), _lesser restoration_, or _protection from poison_ on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn't ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.","rarity":"varies","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"shadow-tome","name":"Shadow Tome","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This unassuming book possesses powerful illusory magics.

King Owain, often called The Lion, personified all the qualities desired in a sovereign. He was intelligent and wise, good and kind, strong and just. Owain went to great lengths to ensure the safety, prosperity, and well-being of his people. He believed all people, regardless of their station in life, deserved to be treated fairly and equally. He codified the realm's first set of laws, and he even specified that no one, not even a king, was above the law. The reign of King Owain the Lion was truly a golden age. On the anniversary of Owain's 30th year on the throne, his lords commissioned a magnificent golden scepter to commemorate the king's long and just reign. Royal wizards and high clerics of the realm bestowed powerful protective magic upon the scepter, which was then presented to the appreciative king. By the time King Owain had reached his seventieth year, he was in failing health. The King transferred power to his young son, Prince Tarrgrin, during a solemn ceremony in which he formally turned over his _sovereign's scepter_ to the young prince. Less than a year later, the great king, the Protector of the Realm, died peacefully in his sleep. The people had hoped that Owain's son would be as wise, strong, and just as his father had been. Alas, it was not to be. Although Tarrgrin tried to live up to his father's example, he was in truth but a shadow of the ruler King Owain had been. Within a few years, most of the lords were in open rebellion. Bitter, furious, and increasingly paranoid, Tarrgrin rejected his father's laws and swiftly imprisoned anyone suspected of treason. The kingdom was soon ripped apart by a bloody civil war. Eventually, the capital city was taken. King Tarrgrin was captured and beheaded, and in the chaos that followed, the _sovereign's scepter_ disappeared. Perhaps it was taken by one of the lords; perhaps it was accidentally destroyed. There are many that believe someone loyal to King Owain's memory took the scepter and hid it away. Rumors say that, when someone truly worthy of Owain's ideals comes forward, the _sovereign's scepter_ will be found once again. While holding this scepter, a critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Once triggered, this property can't be triggered again until the next dawn.","rarity":"fabled ","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic OGL","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"spear-of-the-north","name":"Spear of the North","type":"Weapon","desc":"This spear has an ivory haft, and tiny snowflakes occasionally fall from its tip.

The next morning, he awoke to find a pair of mysterious, black boots on the floor next to his bed. Teegum smiled, knowing at once his prayers had been answered! That very night, the gnome successfully burglarized the royal treasury vaults of Orpesh. Over the next few months, he committed many more crimes, each seemingly more extravagant and daring than the last—heists that would live on in legend and song. Teegum stole the crown jewels of Ipn-tha; he replaced the golden eggs of the Holy Eagle of Bol with exact replicas then sold the originals for a fabulous sum; he strolled undetected into a secret meeting of the great banking consortium of Dalthoon and left with the contents of each member's coin purse. No trap could stop him! Before long, he was fabulously wealthy and had earned quite a reputation. Unfortunately, there was one important lesson Teegum, like many criminals, con men, and tricksters needed to learn the hard way. Luck is a two-way street and the gods of deceit also play tricks on their worshippers. It was a lesson the gnome learned late one rainy, ale-soaked night at the point of a poisoned dagger.

Drinking troll blood that hasn't been diluted provides great healing, but it can also cause odd mutations. To gain the benefits of troll blood, you must drink the viscous substance like a potion. When you drink the troll blood, you regain hit points at the start of each of your turns up to an amount determined by the type of potion. If you take acid or fire damage, this regeneration doesn't function at the start of your next turn. While under the effects of troll blood, you die only if you start your turn with 0 hit points and don't regenerate. In addition, you can reattach a severed body part by holding it in place for 1d4 rounds. However, the potion's magic can't regrow missing body parts. A _potion of troll blood_ continues regenerating your body up to an amount determined by the potion's potency, even if you are restored to your hit point maximum before reaching that amount. Excessive regeneration, especially in a short amount of time, can mutate or even kill creatures that don't naturally regenerate. Although you can't receive healing that exceeds your hit point maximum, the potion's regeneration can cause other effects if it would regenerate hit points beyond your maximum. | dice: 1d% | Mutation |\n| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1–20 | Your skin grows thick and gnarly, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC. However, you become vulnerable to acid damage and fire damage, and when a creature scores a critical hit against you, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice. |\n| 21–30 | Changes in your olfactory system give you a keen sense of smell. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. However, you take 2d6 psychic damage whenever you fail a Wisdom saving throw. |\n| 31–40 | Your eyes develop to accommodate the dark, and you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. However, you take a −4 penalty on Dexterity saving throws. |\n| 41–50 | Claws burst from the ends of your fingers. Your claws are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your claw, it deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. However, your clawed hands make your normal actions more challenging, and you take a −4 penalty on attack rolls with weapons other than your claws. |\n| 51–60 | Your jaw extends, and your teeth grow constantly and haphazardly, only to fall out as new ones take their place. You are proficient with this bite, which deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier piercing damage on a hit. When you make a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to attack that same target with your bite. However, you can no longer verbally communicate, and you can't cast spells with verbal components. |\n| 61–70 | Your arms, shoulders, legs, and back bulge slightly as muscle and sinew double in mass. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. However, your speed is reduced by 10 feet. |\n| 71–80 | Your mind clouds over, enraged and feverish. You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you deal an extra 2 damage of the weapon's type when you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength. However, when you make a melee attack, you have a 50 percent chance of hitting another creature within 5 feet of your target, which can include your allies. |\n| 81–90 | Your blood becomes overly thick, and any damage you take is reduced by 1. However, the thickened blood also hinders your body's natural defenses, and you take a −4 penalty on Constitution saving throws. |\n| 91–00 | You develop an eye-watering reek. When a humanoid or beast starts its turn in a space within 5 feet of you, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving saving throw or use its reaction to move 5 feet away from you. In addition, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. | | dice: 1d% | Mutation |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1–20 | Your form roils and changes constantly and subtly. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. However, this constant changing makes you more susceptible to magic, and you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells. |\n| 21–30 | An extra arm sprouts from somewhere on your body. The arm can't wield weapons or hold items heavier than 5 pounds, but it can provide you some aid, granting you advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. However, the new limb throws off your coordination and sense of balance, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws you make. |\n| 31–40 | You start hemorrhaging excessively when hit, spraying magic-infused blood around you. When a creature hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage. However, any damage you take is increased by 1 as your blood flows more freely. |\n| 41–50 | Subtle changes in your scent and presence attracts humanoids and irritates beasts around you. When interacting socially with humanoids, you have advantage on Charisma checks. However, beasts with an Intelligence of 4 or lower are immediately hostile toward you. |\n| 51–60 | You grow a second, vestigial head. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, harmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and you can't be surprised while conscious. However, the mental input from the secondary head distracts you as it attempts to aid your attack rolls. Whenever you miss an attack roll, you take half the damage you would have dealt to the target. |\n| 61–70 | Your nerves become hyperactive, leading you to jerk, fidget, and move randomly and involuntarily. You gain a +2 bonus to AC as your enemies have a hard time determining your exact location. However, the involuntary movement makes it difficult for you to move and act deliberately. On your turn, you can use either an action or bonus action, not both. |\n| 71–80 | Your body twists, elongates, and forms extra skin or callouses as it adapts itself to a different mode of travel. You gain a burrowing or swimming speed (GM's choice) equal to your base walking speed. However, you speed is halved while walking on land. |\n| 81–90 | Your blood becomes toxic, and you become poisoned. However, while poisoned in this way, you are immune to disease, poison damage, and necrotic damage. |\n| 91–00 | Your metabolism slows imperceptibly, causing you to continue regenerating, albeit slowly. You regain 3 hit points every 10 minutes for the duration of this mutation.

Uthariel's greatest assets were her great cunning and charm, and she used these to orchestrate alliances, eliminate rivals, and ensure outcomes that benefited her and her crown. Yet, with each new alliance or conquest, the young queen grew more uneasy. She was convinced an assassin or plot to dethrone her lay around every corner, and she prayed to the gods in hopes they might keep her safe. In response, they enchanted her royal diadem with great protective powers. Uthariel rejoiced, feeling suddenly invincible. One evening during a formal dinner, the Queen learned a new lady-in-waiting had joined her court. Uthariel was enchanted by the girl's beauty and immediately set about charming her. Later that night, as the two retired to a private room, the young girl innocently remarked at the delicate beauty of Uthariel's diadem. The queen studied the young woman intently, but she could find no hint of deception or ill will. She then allowed the lady-in-waiting to try on the diadem. As the two embraced, the lady-in-waiting stealthily flicked at the ring she wore, revealing a tiny needle, which she quickly pricked into the back of Uthariel's neck. Uthariel gasped.

Osland had already killed two dragons in his lifetime and was determined to make Vrithmytrix his third. Shouting a challenge of honor, the knight attacked! After the titanic battle, Vrithmytrix, the mighty black dragon, was dead. Osland hauled the black dragon's body back to his keep. There, he commissioned the creation of a wonderous suit of armor made from Vrithmytrix's scales and hide. He christened the armor _Vrithmytrix's Bane_**.** Over time, Osland discovered that many of the black dragon's unique qualities had somehow carried over to the armor itself! One dark night almost a year later, Osland felt his entire keep shake. Rushing outside, he saw a large portion of the outer wall had been reduced to rubble, and a massive black dragon was circling overhead. As the terrible beast soared closer, its reptilian eyes widened at the sight of Osland's armor, then quickly narrowed in abject hatred. This was Vrithmytrix's mate, and it was much larger and more powerful than Vrithmytrix had been. Roaring in anger, the dragon swooped down, snatched Osland in its great claws and carried him away into the night sky. Osland was never seen again.

It is said Talvin never forgot a story or fact once he heard it. Toward the end of his life, Talvin collected a great many of these stories into a large, leather-bound book, which he lovingly and meticulously crafted himself. After his death, loyal followers of the bard copied the book's contents and distributed copies throughout the land. These collected works are still studied by sages today and are considered among the greatest historical and literary works ever produced. There are conflicting stories regarding Talvin the Wanderer's final years. Some tales say he became embroiled in the political intrigue of a distant king and eventually felt the executioner's axe. Others say the great bard retired in some far-off land and ended his days in complete solitude. Perhaps the greatest mystery is what became of Talvin's original book, bound and written by Talvin's own hand. Scholars and adventurers alike have tried in vain to discover what became of the bard's book, but so far none have succeeded. Whatever Talvin the Wanderer's fate, his book faded from history. Some say that, upon his death, Talvin's spirit became one with his book, where he revels for all eternity within its tales. The book contains simple stories of the local region, its history, and its religions.

Two packs, each aggressive and dangerous, fought violently for dominance within a large forest, but neither could gain the upper hand. Both sides eventually suffered such losses that the two clans soon found themselves at the mercy of human hunters intent on killing them all. To ensure their survival, the werewolf leaders reluctantly agreed to bury their hatred for one another and the two diminished packs became one. To seal the alliance, each werewolf bestowed a gift upon the other. One pack leader gave the other a magical ring he named _wolf 's howl_. In return, the first pack leader was given a magical horn. For a time, the joined pack existed peacefully, and their combined might allowed them to rule the forest once again. However, the werewolf who possessed the magical horn grew disenchanted. He felt that his gift, the _wolf 's howl ring_, was far greater than the horn he had been given. He believed that the other werewolf pack leader had intentionally given him an inferior gift in order to slight him. Tensions grew between the two werewolves. When the inevitable breaking point came, the ensuing battle involved not only the leaders, but the entire pack. When the bloodbath was over, few of the werewolves remained alive. The victorious werewolf leader bathed his _wolf 's howl ring_ in the blood of his enemy, and the ring absorbed the creature's dying essence into itself. The triumph was short-lived, however. The few survivors of the battle, including the werewolf leader, fell to the silvered arrows of hunters only a few days later.
